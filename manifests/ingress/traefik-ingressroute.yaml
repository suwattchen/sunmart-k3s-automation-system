# Traefik IngressRoute for Database Services (Internal Use Only)
# Note: These are typically not exposed externally. This is a placeholder for internal Traefik routing if needed.
# For K3s, Traefik is usually configured to handle Ingress resources directly.
# The IngressRoute resources are defined within each Helm Chart.

# This file is mainly for the ClusterIssuer and the Namespace/Secrets/ConfigMap
# which are applied before Helm Charts.
